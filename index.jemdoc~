== About me
~~~
I received the MEng degree in [http://www.ece.ntua.gr/ Electrical and Computer Engineering] and the MSc degree in [http://dpms-as.mech.ntua.gr/ Automatic Control Systems and Robotics] both from [http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)] in 2013 and 2015 respectively.

My [diploma_thesis.pdf Diploma Thesis] involved segmentation algorithms and plane registration for mobile robot localization. My [master_thesis.pdf Master Thesis] involved the nonlinear control of multi-agent vehicle agents composing a platoon with prescribed performance guarantees.

Currently, I am a PhD Student at the Department of Automatic Control of KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm) under the guidance of Prof. [http://people.kth.se/~dimos/ Dimos Dimarogonas] and Prof. [http://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/ Danica Kragic]. My research interests include nonlinear control of multi-agent systems, cooperative manipulation tasks and hybrid systems.
