<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>I received the MEng degree in <a href="http://www.ece.ntua.gr/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> and the MSc degree in <a href="http://dpms-as.mech.ntua.gr/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Automatic Control Systems and Robotics</a> both from <a href="http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)</a> in 2013 and 2015 respectively.

My <a href="diploma_thesis.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Diploma Thesis</a> involved segmentation algorithms and plane registration for mobile robot localization. My <a href="master_thesis.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Master Thesis</a> involved the nonlinear control of multi-agent vehicle agents composing a platoon with prescribed performance guarantees.

I received the PhD in Electrical Engineering from KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm) under the guidance of Prof. <a href="http://people.kth.se/~dimos/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Dimos Dimarogonas</a> and Prof. <a href="http://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Danica Kragic</a>. My <a href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1427745/FULLTEXT01.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>PhD Thesis</a> involved planning and control of multi-robot manipulator-endowed systems. 

My PhD thesis was awarded the EECI PhD award on Control for Complex and Heterogeneous Systems 2021 and was selected to be one of the finalists for the EuRobotics Georges Giralt PhD award 2021.
